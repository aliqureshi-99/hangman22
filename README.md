## Description
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where the computer selects a random word, and the user attempts to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. This project aims to implement the Hangman game in Python, demonstrating basic programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and user input validation.

### What I Learned
- Basic Python programming
- Using the `random` module
- Conditional statements and loops
- Validating user input
- Refactoring code for readability and maintainability

## Installation
To get started with the Hangman game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd hangman-game
    ```

## Usage
To run the Hangman game, execute the following command:
```bash
python milestone_5.py
